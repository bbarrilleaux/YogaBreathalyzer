YogaBreathalyzer
================

Arduino-controlled Yoga breathing trainer using wind/temperature sensor and LED strip. The code also uses a separate temperature sensor as input and displays the temperature in C and F on an LCD screen. These two parts are separate -- either or both will work, depending what's plugged into the Arduino.
